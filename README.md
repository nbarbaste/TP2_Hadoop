# Hadoop TP2 - ECE 

This repository contains the .java for the 3 questions of the TP2

* Exo1.java -> Answer the first question of the TP2 [Count first name by origin]
* Exo2.java -> Answer the second question of the TP2 [Count number of first name by number of origin (how many first name has x origins ? For x = 1,2,3...)]
* Exo3.java -> Answer the third question of the TP2 [Proportion (in%) of male or female] => I've only done the first part of this question, which counts the number of female and male names using M/R

(WordCount.java is the example used to answer the questions)
